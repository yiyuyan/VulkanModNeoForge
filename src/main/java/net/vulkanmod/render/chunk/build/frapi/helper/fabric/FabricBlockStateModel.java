     * should be considered deprecated as they may not produce accurate results.</b> However, it is acceptable for a
     * custom model to only implement the vanilla methods as the default implementation of this method will delegate to
     * one of the vanilla methods.
     *
     * <p>Like {@link BlockStateModel#collectParts(RandomSource, List)}, this method may be called outside of chunk rebuilds. For
     * example, some entities and block entities render blocks. In some such cases, the provided position may be the
     * <em>nearest</em> position and not actual position. In others, the provided world may be
     * {@linkplain EmptyBlockAndTintGetter#INSTANCE empty}.
     *
     * <p>If multiple independent subtasks use the provided random, it is recommended that implementations
     * {@linkplain RandomSource#setSeed(long) reseed} the random using a predetermined value before invoking each subtask, so
     * that one subtask's operations do not affect the next subtask. For example, if a model collects geometry from
     * multiple submodels, each submodel is considered a subtask and thus the random should be reseeded before
     * collecting geometry from each submodel. See {@link MultiPartModel#collectParts(RandomSource, List)} for an
     * example implementation of this.
     *
     * <p>Implementations should rely on pre-baked meshes as much as possible and keep dynamic transformations to a
     * minimum for performance.
     *
     * <p>Implementations should generally also override {@link #createGeometryKey}.

     *                 this method must account for this. In general, prefer using
